        <h1>Varieties of Spanning Tree Protocols</h1>
        <h2>PVST+</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>STP facilitates the logical loop-free path throughout the broadcast domain. The spanning tree is determined through the information learned by the exchange of the BPDU frames between the interconnected switches. To facilitate the learning of the logical spanning tree, each switch port transitions through five possible port states and three BPDU timers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The spanning tree is determined immediately after a switch is finished booting up. If a switch port transitions directly from the blocking to the forwarding state without information about the full topology during the transition, the port can temporarily create a data loop. For this reason, STP introduces the five port states. The figure describes the following port states that ensure no loops are created during the creation of the logical spanning tree:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Blocking </b>- The port is an alternate port and does not participate in frame forwarding. The port receives BPDU frames to determine the location and root ID of the root bridge switch and what port roles each switch port should assume in the final active STP topology.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Listening </b>- Listens for the path to the root. STP has determined that the port can participate in frame forwarding according to the BPDU frames that the switch has received thus far. At this point, the switch port not only receives BPDU frames, it also transmits its own BPDU frames and inform adjacent switches that the switch port is preparing to participate in the active topology.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Learning </b>- Learns the MAC addresses. The port prepares to participate in frame forwarding and begins to populate the MAC address table. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Forwarding </b>- The port is considered part of the active topology.  It forwards data frames and sends and receives BPDU frames. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Disabled </b>- The Layer 2 port does not participate in spanning tree and does not forward frames. The disabled state is set when the switch port is administratively disabled.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Note that the number of ports in each of the various states (blocking, listening, learning, or forwarding) can be displayed with the<span class="cmd"><b> show spanning-tree summary </b></span>command.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For each VLAN in a switched network, PVST+ performs four steps to provide a loop-free logical network topology:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>1. Elects one root bridge </b>- Only one switch can act as the root bridge (for a given VLAN). The root bridge is the switch with the lowest bridge ID. On the root bridge, all ports are designated ports (in particular, no root ports).</p>
          <p>
            <b>2. Selects the root port on each non-root bridge </b>- STP establishes one root port on each non-root bridge. The root port is the lowest-cost path from the non-root bridge to the root bridge, indicating the direction of the best path to the root bridge. Root ports are normally in the forwarding state.</p>
          <p>
            <b>3. Selects the designated port on each segment </b>- On each link, STP establishes one designated port. The designated port is selected on the switch that has the lowest-cost path to the root bridge. Designated ports are normally in the forwarding state, forwarding traffic for the segment. </p>
          <p>
            <b>4. The remaining ports in the switched network are alternate ports </b>- Alternate ports normally remain in the blocking state, to logically break the loop topology. When a port is in the blocking state, it does not forward traffic, but can still process received BPDU messages.</p>
