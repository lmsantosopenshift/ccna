          <p>Problems that can result from a redundant Layer 2 network include broadcast storms, MAC database instability, and duplicate unicast frames. STP is a Layer 2 protocol that ensures that there is only one logical path between all destinations on the network by intentionally blocking redundant paths that could cause a loop.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>STP sends BPDU frames for communication between switches. One switch is elected as the root bridge for each instance of spanning tree. An administrator can control this election by changing the bridge priority. Root bridges can be configured to enable spanning tree load balancing by VLAN or by a group of VLANs, depending on the spanning tree protocol used. STP then assigns a port role to each participating port using a path cost. The path cost is equal to the sum of all the port costs along the path to the root bridge. A port cost is automatically assigned to each port; however, it can also be manually configured. Paths with the lowest cost become preferred, and all other redundant paths are blocked.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>PVST+ is the default configuration of IEEE 802.1D on Cisco switches. It runs one instance of STP for each VLAN. A newer, faster-converging spanning tree protocol, RSTP, can be implemented on Cisco switches on a per-VLAN basis in the form of Rapid PVST+. Multiple Spanning Tree (MST) is the Cisco implementation of Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP), where one instance of spanning tree runs for a defined group of VLANs.  Features such as PortFast and BPDU guard ensure that hosts in the switched environment are provided immediate access to the network without interfering with spanning tree operation.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>First Hop Redundancy Protocols, such as HSRP, VRRP, and GLBP provide alternate default gateways for hosts in the redundant router or multilayer switched environment. Multiple routers share a virtual IP address and MAC address that is used as the default gateway on a client. This ensures that hosts maintain connectivity in the event of the failure of one device serving as a default gateway for a VLAN or set of VLANs. When using HSRP or VRRP, one router is active or forwarding for a particular group while others are in standby mode. GLBP allows the simultaneous use of multiple gateways in addition to providing automatic failover.</p>
