        <h2>Varieties of First Hop Redundancy Protocols</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>The following list defines the options available for First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRPs), as shown in the figure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)</b> - A Cisco-proprietary FHRP designed to allow for transparent failover of a first-hop IPv4 device. HSRP provides high network availability by providing first-hop routing redundancy for IPv4 hosts on networks configured with an IPv4 default gateway address. HSRP is used in a group of routers for selecting an active device and a standby device. In a group of device interfaces, the active device is the device that is used for routing packets; the standby device is the device that takes over when the active device fails, or when pre-set conditions are met. The function of the HSRP standby router is to monitor the operational status of the HSRP group and to quickly assume packet-forwarding responsibility if the active router fails.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>HSRP for IPv6</b> - Cisco-proprietary FHRP providing the same functionality of HSRP, but in an IPv6 environment. An HSRP IPv6 group has a virtual MAC address derived from the HSRP group number and a virtual IPv6 link-local address derived from the HSRP virtual MAC address. Periodic router advertisements (RAs) are sent for the HSRP virtual IPv6 link-local address when the HSRP group is active. When the group becomes inactive these RAs stop after a final RA is sent. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol version 2 (VRRPv2)</b> - A non-proprietary election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for one or more virtual routers to the VRRP routers on an IPv4 LAN. This allows several routers on a multiaccess link to use the same virtual IPv4 address. A VRRP router is configured to run the VRRP protocol in conjunction with one or more other routers attached to a LAN. In a VRRP configuration, one router is elected as the virtual router master, with the other routers acting as backups, in case the virtual router master fails.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>VRRPv3 </b>- Provides the capability to support IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. VRRPv3 works in multi-vendor environments and is more scalable than VRRPv2.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) </b>- Cisco-proprietary FHRP that protects data traffic from a failed router or circuit, like HSRP and VRRP, while also allowing load balancing (also called load sharing) between a group of redundant routers.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>GLBP for IPv6</b> - Cisco-proprietary FHRP providing the same functionality of GLBP, but in an IPv6 environment. GLBP for IPv6 provides automatic router backup for IPv6 hosts configured with a single default gateway on a LAN. Multiple first-hop routers on the LAN combine to offer a single virtual first-hop IPv6 router while sharing the IPv6 packet forwarding load.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>ICMP Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP)</b> - Specified in RFC 1256, is a legacy FHRP solution. IRDP allows IPv4 hosts to locate routers that provide IPv4 connectivity to other (nonlocal) IP networks.</li>
            </ul>
